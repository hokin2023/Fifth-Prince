# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The problems were solved are adding decoration to different time blocks and getting items from local storage to display when refreshing.

I felt highly motivated doing this assigment because it sharpend my JS skills and brought me one step closer to sucess.

Lastly, I was able to learn how to build a basic planner using JS.

## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

## Usage

- Enter things to do in the text areas 
- Click the save buttons
- Your texts will be saved in Local Storage
- Refresh the page to see if the events are still there
